## Implementation

Maffin is implemented using <a href="https://typeorm.io/" target="_blank">TypeOrm</a> entities that are stored in the browser. Whenever you do a change, all the data is uploaded to Google Drive. The schemas are extracted from <a href="https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">Gnucash schemas</a>.

> I was a user of Gnucash before building this. The main reason I used the same schemas is because I knew they would be better than anything I can think of and because I wanted to easily migrate the years of data I had.

## Developing

- Clone this repo.
- Install dependencies with `yarn`.
- Run the frontend with `yarn maffin:dev`. This will run using the local demo data.

Happy coding 🥳.
